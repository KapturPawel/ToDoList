To do list

Project that I am working on since late of december 2017. It's web application that is saving tasks for user. Program is using several technologies. It's build with springboot and maven. Java is used on backend. Hibernate is used for connecting to mySQL database. Application is using mvc pattern.

Work still in progress. For now i have plan to introduce registration and private lists of tasks for different users.
